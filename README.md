Firstly many thanks for the opportunity to do this coding test. 

Both the required and the optional tasks were completed.

I really enjoyed this code challenge, for a number of reasons.

The task itself was simple in concept, though like many coding exercises there can be a number of ways you can go about getting to the end result. Handling the look forward/look back scoring process I found challenging in terms of how best to architect the app, re keeping the code lean and expressive whilst also managing the required in app state. I dont pretend for a second that what I am presenting here is the ultimate approach. I never ever(!) assume and generally am always looking for a better/more efficient/practical/maintainable way - for me that's one of the beauties of software development. That being so I do obviously hope that I've gone as close as I can to satisfying what you are looking for here. 

I also love the TDD approach and all I'll say, is "what's not to love!". Aside from the obvious best practices re the dev workflow/lifecycle, for me it's just quite addictive and I'd almost go as far as saying it somewhat "gamifies" app development :-)  You can see my Git commit flow, where I checked in after each successful test. I do know, that I can improve in this area. It's something I very much hope DiUS can help me with via ongoing coaching & advice.

Lastly, I did deliberately leave out code comments in this instance so you could simply focus on the code for review. I know that VS has comment folding etc. but nonetheless I still went ahead in this manner, for this particular test. Hope that is ok. 

The app was written in C# (Console app), using Visual Studio 2015 (Update 1). Note that there's some placeholder code in Program.cs for testing to the console if needed.

Thanks again and I do hope I'll have the opportunity to work with DiUS in the near future.


Kind regards,

Angus
